Project2 Deliverable 2

My public key is called public.pem and my private key is called private.pem

The program project2_encryption.cpp takes as command line parameters the encrypted message
file, a public key, and a private key in this order. an example of this would be 
	./a.out symm_key.bin pubkey.pem private.pem


The file msg.txt that holds the message "Ivan Nieto\n800629123\n" is encrypted using 256 
bit aes with the key being the created symmetric key from step two of the problem. 

The program project2_decrypt.cpp takes as command like parameters the signed file from the
previous program called sec.signed.base64.enc. This file is made when calling the openssl
commands from the program and thus should not change in name. The second command line 
argument is the corresponding public key to the private key that was provided to the 
project2_encrypt.cpp program. The final command line argument is the symmetric key file
that was produced from the project2_encrypt.cpp program. This file is also created when 
calling the openssl command from the program and thus should not change in name. The last 
argument should be the encrypted file that was created in the last program called sec.enc. 
This file is created when calling the openssl commands and should not change in name.
An example of the expected command line parameters for the program is 
	./a.out sec.signed.base64.enc public.pem symmetric.txt sec.enc

To compile both programs simply type make and the makefile will compile and run both programs. 

The final decrypted file is stored in msg.txt.decrypted
