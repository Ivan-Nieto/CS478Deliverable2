The program project2_encryption.cpp takes as command line parameters the encrypted message
file, a public key, and a private key in this order. an example of this would be 
	./a.out symm_key.bin pubkey.pem private.pem

The program project2_decrypt.cpp takes as command like parameters the signed file from the
previous program called sec.signed.base64.enc. This file is made when calling the openssl
commands from the program and thus should not change in name. The second command line 
argument is the corresponding public key to the private key that was provided to the 
project2_encrypt.cpp program. The final command line argument is the symmetric key file
that was produced from the project2_encrypt.cpp program. This file is also created when 
calling the openssl command from the program and thus should not change in name. An example
of the expected command line parameters for the program is 
	./a.out sec.signed.base64.enc public.pem symmetric.txt

To compile both programs simply type make and the makefile will compile and run both programs.
